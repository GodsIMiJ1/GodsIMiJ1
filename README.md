## What I Build

I design and deploy **secure, production-grade AI backend systems and infrastructure** for founders, clinics, and organizations building real AI products — systems that don't just demo well, but hold up under production load, regulatory scrutiny, and long-term maintenance.

My architecture is built around three non-negotiables:

- **Data sovereignty** — your data stays under your control, on your hardware or in your hybrid environment
- **Operational stability** — systems that scale under load and remain maintainable years from now
- **Governance by design** — security and compliance are structural, not bolt-on

If you're building something that matters, I build the infrastructure it runs on.

## Selected Projects

### 🔷 GhostChat AI Template
**Production-ready AI application scaffold**  
Next.js + Supabase + OpenAI integration. Designed for founders and developers who need a clean, secure starting point for AI-powered applications — not a toy demo, a real deployable product baseline.

---

### 🔷 DataOps Terminal
**AI infrastructure control interface**  
A backend-focused command and control interface for managing LLM systems, data pipelines, and infrastructure operations. Built for teams that need operational visibility into their AI stack.

---

### 🔷 AuthStarter
**Secure authentication boilerplate**  
Enterprise-grade auth scaffolding for scalable applications. Handles token management, session security, role-based access, and integrates cleanly into larger AI system architectures.

---

### 🔷 AURA-BREE Platform
**Sovereign clinical AI companion system**  
A governance-first, local-first AI deployment for regulated healthcare environments. Three-tier architecture: patient companion interface, staff training layer, and administrative automation. Designed for methadone clinics and other regulated care settings where data sovereignty and compliance are non-negotiable.  
*Reference implementation of the BACC Framework (Build · Automate · Create · Connect).*

---

### 🔷 GhostMesh Control Plane *(In Development)*
**LAN-based remote command orchestration system**  
Agent-based architecture operating entirely on private networks. Built for organizations that require full operational control without cloud dependencies — sovereign infrastructure at the network layer.

---

## Frameworks & Methodology

### BACC Framework
*Build · Automate · Create · Connect*

A governance-first methodology for deploying AI in regulated environments. BACC treats compliance, data ownership, and operational resilience as foundational design constraints — not afterthoughts. Developed and refined through real-world deployments in healthcare and enterprise contexts.

### Engineering Philosophy
AI systems should be:
- **Stable** — predictable behavior under load and over time
- **Scalable** — architecture that grows with the organization
- **Sovereign** — data and logic that remain under the operator's control

Cloud dependency is a risk vector. Subscription lock-in is a liability. Real infrastructure is owned, not rented.

## Availability

I take on a limited number of engagements at a time to ensure quality work and real outcomes.

**Open to:**
- AI backend architecture consulting
- Infrastructure design & deployment for regulated environments
- Secure LLM integration (local, hybrid, or cloud)
- Production AI system builds from architecture to deployment
- Governance-first AI strategy for healthcare and enterprise

**Not a fit for:**
- Prototype-only / no-deployment-path projects
- Cloud-lock-in dependency architectures
- Subscription SaaS that trades ownership for convenience
