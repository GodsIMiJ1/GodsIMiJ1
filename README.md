## What I Build

I design and deploy secure, production-grade AI backend systems and infrastructure for founders, clinics, and organizations building real AI products — systems that do not just demo well, but hold up under production load, regulatory scrutiny, and long-term maintenance.

My architecture is built around three non-negotiables:

- **Data sovereignty** — your data stays under your control, on your hardware or in your hybrid environment
- **Operational stability** — systems that scale under load and remain maintainable years from now
- **Governance by design** — security and compliance are structural, not bolt-on

If you're building something that matters, I build the infrastructure it runs on.

## Open Architecture Templates

Alongside private production work, I publish a limited number of **architectural demo templates**.

These repositories are:

- Structured foundations, not finished SaaS products  
- Interface and system design demonstrations  
- Intentionally simplified at the backend layer  
- Designed to illustrate architectural philosophy and modular structure  

Core production infrastructure, scaling layers, orchestration engines, and security hardening are intentionally not exposed in public repositories.

These templates serve as:

- Capability demonstrations  
- Starting points for serious builders  
- Conversation starters for enterprise engagements  

Production deployments are developed through direct collaboration.

## Development Activity


1,440+ contributions in the past year
280+ repositories
Consistent daily commits · Long-term system evolution


**Primary focus areas:**
- AI backend systems & LLM orchestration pipelines
- Sovereign infrastructure tooling & control planes
- Production-ready scaffolding and deployment templates
- Secure local and hybrid LLM deployments
- Governance-first AI system architecture

## Selected Projects

### 🔷 GhostChat AI Template
Architectural AI application scaffold  
Next.js + Supabase + OpenAI integration. Designed as a structured foundation for founders who need a clean starting point for AI-powered applications. Production expansions are developed privately.

---

### 🔷 DataOps Terminal
AI infrastructure control interface  
Backend-focused command and control interface for managing LLM systems, data pipelines, and infrastructure operations.

---

### 🔷 AuthStarter
Secure authentication scaffold  
Enterprise-ready auth foundation designed for extensibility into larger AI system architectures.

---

### 🔷 AURA-BREE Platform
Sovereign clinical AI companion system  
Governance-first, local-first AI deployment for regulated healthcare environments. Designed for methadone clinics and other care settings where data sovereignty and compliance are non-negotiable.

---

### 🔷 GhostMesh Control Plane *(In Development)*
LAN-based remote command orchestration system  
Agent-based architecture operating entirely on private networks. Built for organizations that require full operational control without cloud dependency.

## Engineering Philosophy

AI systems should be:

- Stable — predictable behavior under load and over time  
- Scalable — architecture that grows with the organization  
- Sovereign — data and logic that remain under operator control  

Cloud dependency is a risk vector. Subscription lock-in is a liability. Real infrastructure is owned, not rented.
